        <h2>Bridging Geology and Software for a Sustainable Future</h2>
        <p>Inspired by my passion for geology and sustainability, I created the Environmental Impact Tracker. This web application links geology with software development, offering affordable solutions to regulate your carbon footprint. My goal is to contribute to saving the environment for future generations.</p>
        <p>As the sole developer, I've dedicated myself to this project. Every aspect, from design to development, reflects my commitment to sustainability and belief in technology's power for positive change. Join me in making a differenceâ€”one footprint at a time. Some of my other projects can be found below.</p>
